    <h1>Tired of grubby festival toilets with no loo roll? We've got you covered..</h1>
    <p>We’ve all been there - creeping into a dingy portaloo, awaiting the stench when you really can’t hold it in anymore. That’s why we’re bringing luxurious toilets to festivals around the British Isles this coming festival season. With mirrors and lighting, more space, soap and of course regular cleans, our state of the art loos are the business!</p>

    <p>Set up just a year ago, the business has been planning and preparing for the upcoming season with high anticipation. We have secured places at some of the most popular UK and Irish festivals including BBC Radio 1’s Big Weekend, Reading and Leeds, Wireless, Parklife, Electric Picnic and more! If you’re interested, make sure you tell us which festivals you'll be attending this season, we'll be sure to check them out.</p>

    <p>Each cubicle has a toilet, a sink with hot and cold water, a mirror with lighting, hand soap and cream, hand towels and luxury toilet paper. Staff check and clean the toilets every thirty minutes to ensure they’re tidy, hygienic and fully stocked. When the weather takes a turn for the worse, we cover the facilities using a large stretch tent ensuring everyone stays dry and mud-free. For some of the larger events we also provide showering and changing facilities and hair washing and styling stations, so you can look festival chic all weekend long!</p>

    <p>Don’t believe us? Check it out for yourself in our gallery, showing just a few of our toilet units.</p>
